- Output: Comma-separated string of the first `a` odd numbers starting from 1

---

### Problem-3: Series Generation – Selective Odd Numbers
Conditionally generates odd numbers based on input.

**Details:**
- Input: Integer `a`
- If `a` is even, generate `a / 2` odd numbers
- If `a` is odd, generate `(a + 1) / 2` odd numbers
- Output: Comma-separated string of generated values

---

### Problem-4: Dictionary Count of Multiples
Counts how many numbers in a list are divisible by values from 1 to 9.

**Details:**
